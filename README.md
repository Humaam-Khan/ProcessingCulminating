# ProcessingCulminating
A prototype game that uses exclusively processing (alongside some assets). Animations are the only thing that was implemented for the project.

# Gameplay
The main gameplay consists of an RPG-like game with "monsters" that you fight with or against. Each monster has a learnset and the game would've had 10 "waves" for the player to triumph in order to win. Waves would be randomly generated and the player can choose to tame a monster or to defeat it for EXP.

# Elements
Naturally, being coded in Processing means it's an OOP game. There are classes for animations, buttons, monsters etc etc.. At the time my knowledge of design patterns was somewhat thin, so many aspects (especially the animations) are hard-coded in.

# Utilization
To play the game, download "TheGame" folder and then open up "Main.pde" in processing.

To view the animations, you can create an animation object and then run any of the animations from the class. An example is shown in the main file at line 132
